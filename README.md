# Life Manager (name pending)
## an app to help you manage your life

Features (planned):

 - Create and manage tasks with an integrated calendar

 - Pomodoro timer with task time tracking

 - Achievements!

 - More to come as more of the app is developed. It's still in baby mode right now.

 # Todo:

 - User sign up, sign in, management, 0auth

 - Calendar widget

 - Task system (create and manage tasks, connect tasks to calendar somehow, I have not planned how yet)

 - Achiements after functionality is all added (Im adding these for two reasons. The primary one is that I want to use this app too. Im really making it for me :D And when playing games recently, Ive found that I enjoy achievement hunting. So, achievements might provide incentive. This will also be a way for me to try out the twitter api to tweet when a person gets an achievement and thats free advertisment for my app [that i dont have plans to monotise really])
